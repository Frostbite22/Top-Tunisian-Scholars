# RANKING of top 1000 Scholars at Tunisian Universities based on h-index

The h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of the publications, initially used for an individual scientist or scholar. The h-index correlates with obvious success indicators such as winning the Nobel Prize, being accepted for research fellowships and holding positions at top universities.

## metrics 
What is a Good h-Index? Hirsch reckons that after 20 years of research, an h-index of 20 is good, 40 is outstanding, and 60 is truly exceptional.

## Scope 
This project is build by scraping the google scholars for Tunisian university. It contains 2130 scholars from different univerities, with different research fields and interests.

## Objective 
This project's intent is to refect the real impact and contribution of Tunisian universities on research in general and on the qualities of higher education in Tunisia.

## Significatant statistics 
Average h-index : 8.2

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Things to be done in this project (contributions are welcomed)
#### Average h-index by research field ( most successful fields )
#### standard deviation from all authors ( we have many with zero publications ) 
#### number of scholars working on each field
